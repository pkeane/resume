##### _Chief Architect/Programmer for Tower Online Learning Environment project:_

- Designed and programmed the Tower application, a real-time web application for introductory Psychology at UT Austin. Used by 1500 students in Fall 2012 (one class of 500, one class of 1000) the Tower application provides benchmark quizzing, data collection (demographic surveys and psychological tests), class materials (text, audio, and video) and real-time chat.  The application is used live during class for student both on an off campus (live video streaming is included). Quizzes and surveys delivered to student are dynamically generated based on the student's previous quizzes, demographics, and/or scores on psychological measures.  For the chat component, students are broken up into small chat "rooms" either randomly or based on previously collected data.  All interactions are saved, analysed (natural language processing) and fed back into the system both for live feedback and dynamic content-generation. This data will also be used by researchers studying interaction models and its effects on learning.
